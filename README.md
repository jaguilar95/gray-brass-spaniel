# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

This is a work day scheduler. When a user opens the document, a 8:00 am - 5:00 pm hourly scheduler is presented for the current day. The user can click on the text area and enter their items into it. When exiting the area, the items will be saved into local storage and will persist on reload. Each of the hour elements will have updated styles to be past, on, or after the hour.
